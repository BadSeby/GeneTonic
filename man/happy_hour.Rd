\arguments{
\item{dds}{A \code{DESeqDataSet} object, normally obtained after running your data
through the \code{DESeq2} framework.}

\item{res_de}{A \code{DESeqResults} object. As for the \code{dds} parameter, this is
also commonly used in the \code{DESeq2} framework.}

\item{res_enrich}{A \code{data.frame} object, storing the result of the functional
enrichment analysis. See \code{\link[=GeneTonic]{GeneTonic()}} for the formatting requirements.}

\item{annotation_obj}{A \code{data.frame} object with the feature annotation
information, with at least two columns, \code{gene_id} and \code{gene_name}. See
\code{\link[=GeneTonic]{GeneTonic()}} for the formatting requirements.}

\item{project_id}{A character string, which can be considered as an identifier
for the set/session, and will be e.g. used in the title of the report created
via \code{\link[=happy_hour]{happy_hour()}}}

\item{mygenesets}{A vector of character strings, containing...}

\item{mygenes}{A vector of character strings, containing...}

\item{usage_mode}{A character string, which controls the behavior of the Rmd
document, based on whether the rendering is triggered while using the app
("shiny_mode"), or offline, in batch mode. Defaults to "batch_mode".}

\item{input_rmd}{Character string with the path to the RMarkdown (.Rmd) file
that will be used as the template for generating the report. Defaults to NULL,
which will then use the one provided with the \code{GeneTonic} package.}

\item{output_file}{Character string, specifying the file name of the output
report. The file name extension must be either \code{.html} or \code{.pdf}, and consistent
with the value of \code{output_format}.}

\item{output_dir}{Character, defininf the path to the output directory where
the report will be generated. Defaults to the current directory (\verb{./}).}

\item{output_format}{The format of the output report. Either \code{html_document}
or \code{pdf_document}. The file name extension of \code{output_file} must be consistent
with this choice. Can also be left empty and determined accordingly.}

\item{force_overwrite}{Logical, whether to force overwrite an existing report
with the same name in the output directory. Defaults to FALSE.}

\item{knitr_show_progress}{Logical, whether to display the progress of \code{knitr}
while generating the report. Defaults to FALSE.}

\item{ignore_pandoc}{Logical, controlling how the report generation function
will behave if \code{pandoc} or \code{pandoc-citeproc} are missing.}

\item{open_after_creating}{Logical, whether to open the report in the default
browser after being generated. Defaults to TRUE.}

\item{...}{Other arguments that will be passed to \code{\link[rmarkdown:render]{rmarkdown::render()}}.}
}
\value{
Generates a fully fledged report in the \code{output_dir} directory, called
\code{output_file} and returns (invisibly) the name of the generated report.
}
\description{
Start the happy hour, creating a report containing a document full of goodies
derived from the provided objects.
}
\details{
When \code{happy_hour} is called, a RMarkdown template file will be copied
into the output directory, and \code{\link[rmarkdown:render]{rmarkdown::render()}} will be called to
generate the final report.

As a default template, \code{happy_hour} uses the one delivered together with the
\code{GeneTonic} package, which provides a comprehensive overview of what the user
can extract. Experienced users can take that as a starting point to further
edit and customize.

If there is already a .Rmd file with the same name in the output directory,
the function will raise an error and stop, to avoid overwriting the existing
file. The reason for this behaviour is that the copied template in the output
directory will be deleted once the report is generated.

Credits to the original implementation proposed by Charlotte Soneson,
upon which this function is \strong{heavily} inspired.
