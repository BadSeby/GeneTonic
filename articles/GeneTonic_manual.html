<a href="#introduction" class="anchor"></a>Introduction</h1>
<p>This vignette describes how to use the <em><a href="https://bioconductor.org/packages/3.11/GeneTonic">GeneTonic</a></em> package for analyzing and integrating the results from Differential Expression analysis and functional enrichment analysis.</p>
<p>This package provides a Shiny application that aims to combine at different levels the existing pieces of the transcriptome data and results, in a way that makes it easier to generate insightful observations and hypothesis - combining the benefits of interactivity and reproducibility, e.g. by capturing the features and gene sets of interest highlighted during the live session, and creating an HTML report as an artifact where text, code, and output coexist.</p>
<p>In order to use <em><a href="https://bioconductor.org/packages/3.11/GeneTonic">GeneTonic</a></em> in your workflow, the following inputs are required:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<code>dds</code>, a <code>DESeqDataSet</code> containing the expression matrix;</li>
<li>
<code>res_de</code>, a <code>DESeqResults</code>, i.e. a <code>DataFrame</code> storing the results of the differentially expression analysis;</li>
<li>
<code>res_enrich</code>, a <code>data.frame</code> with the results of functional enrichment analysis;</li>
<li>
<code>annotation_obj</code>, a <code>data.frame</code> with the correspondence between identifiers for the features under inspection in the <code>dds</code> object.</li>
</ul>
<p>This workflow has mainly been tested with expression matrices with Ensembl identifiers, which are consistent and unambiguous across different releases, and results from functional enrichment analysis originating from ORA (OverRepresentation Analysis) methods, on the Gene Ontology signature database. It may need to be slightly adjusted to work with other formats and sources, but the core functionality will remain available.</p>
<p>In the remainder of this vignette, we will illustrate the main features of <em><a href="https://bioconductor.org/packages/3.11/GeneTonic">GeneTonic</a></em> on a publicly available dataset from Alasoo, et al. “Shared genetic effects on chromatin and gene expression indicate a role for enhancer priming in immune response”, published in Nature Genetics, January 2018 <span class="citation">(Alasoo et al. 2018)</span> <a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41588-018-0046-7">doi:10.1038/s41588-018-0046-7</a>.</p>
<p>The data is made available via the <em><a href="https://bioconductor.org/packages/3.11/macrophage">macrophage</a></em> Bioconductor package, which contains the files output from the Salmon quantification (version 0.12.0, with Gencode v29 reference), as well as the values summarized at the gene level, which we will use to exemplify.</p>
<p>In the <code>macrophage</code> experimental setting, the samples are available from 6 different donors, in 4 different conditions (naive, treated with Interferon gamma, with SL1344, or with a combination of Interferon gamma and SL1344). We will restrict our attention on the comparison between Interferon gamma treated samples vs naive samples.</p>

<a href="#getting-started" class="anchor"></a>Getting started</h1>
<p>To install this package, start R and enter:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb1"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb1-1" data-line-number="1"><span class="cf">if</span> (<span class="op">!</span><span class="kw"><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/base/ns-load.html">requireNamespace</a></span>(<span class="st">"BiocManager"</span>, <span class="dt">quietly =</span> <span class="ot">TRUE</span>))</a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb1-2" data-line-number="2">    <span class="kw"><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/utils/install.packages.html">install.packages</a></span>(<span class="st">"BiocManager"</span>)</a>

<p>Once installed, the package can be loaded and attached to your current workspace as follows:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb2"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb2-1" data-line-number="1"><span class="kw"><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/base/library.html">library</a></span>(<span class="st">"GeneTonic"</span>)</a></code></pre></div>
<p>If you have all four input elements ready, you can launch the <code><a href="../reference/GeneTonic.html">GeneTonic()</a></code> app by running:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb3"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb3-1" data-line-number="1"><span class="kw"><a href="../reference/GeneTonic.html">GeneTonic</a></span>(<span class="dt">dds =</span> dds_object,</a>

<a class="sourceLine" id="cb3-4" data-line-number="4">          <span class="dt">annotation_obj =</span> annotation_object,</a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb3-5" data-line-number="5">          <span class="dt">project_id =</span> <span class="st">"myFirstGeneTonic"</span>)</a></code></pre></div>
<p>In this vignette, we showcase the functionality of <em><a href="https://bioconductor.org/packages/3.11/GeneTonic">GeneTonic</a></em> using the gene-level summarized version of the <code>macrophage</code> dataset. If you want to dive in and start playing with the app immediately, you can simply run:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb4"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb4-1" data-line-number="1"><span class="kw"><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/utils/example.html">example</a></span>(<span class="st">"GeneTonic"</span>, <span class="dt">ask =</span> <span class="ot">FALSE</span>)</a></code></pre></div>
<p>Otherwise, you can follow the next chunks of code to generate the required input objects, step by step. In case some formatting requirements are expected, these will be specified in the text/comments, and they will be checked internally upon launching the <code>GeneTonic</code> app.</p>
<p>For running <code>GeneTonic</code>, you will need the four components mentioned above as parameters.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>
<code>dds</code>: First you will need a <code>DESeqDataSet</code>, which is the main component in the <code>DESeq2</code> framework and extends the widely adopted <code>SummarizedExperiment</code> class. This object will store the information related to the expression matrix.</li>
</ol>

<p><code>res_de</code>: Next you are going to need the results of Differential Expression analysis, computed on the <code>dds_macrophage</code> object you just obtained.</p>
<p>The expected format is a <code>DESeqResults</code> object. Here we are going to contrast two different conditions, <code>IFNg</code> and <code>naive</code>, while controlling for the cell line of origin (which has 6 levels, namely naive, IFNg, IFNg_SL1344, and SL1344).</p>
<p>We start by filtering lowly expressed features (at least 10 counts in at least 6 samples - 6 being the size of the smallest group). Then, we test against a null hypothesis of a log2FoldChange of 1 (instead of the default value of 0), in order to specify that we want to call DE genes with a consistent <em>and</em> robust expression change. Finally, we add the gene symbol to the output <code>DataFrame</code>.</p>

<p><strong>Q: Why is this package called GeneTonic?</strong></p>
