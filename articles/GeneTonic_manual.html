<a href="#introduction" class="anchor"></a>Introduction</h1>
<p>This vignette describes how to use the <em><a href="https://bioconductor.org/packages/3.11/GeneTonic">GeneTonic</a></em> package for analyzing and integrating the results from Differential Expression analysis and functional enrichment analysis.</p>
<p>This package provides a Shiny application that aims to combine at different levels the existing pieces of the transcriptome data and results, in a way that makes it easier to generate insightful observations and hypothesis - combining the benefits of interactivity and reproducibility, e.g. by capturing the features and gene sets of interest highlighted during the live session, and creating an HTML report as an artifact where text, code, and output coexist.</p>
<p>In order to use <em><a href="https://bioconductor.org/packages/3.11/GeneTonic">GeneTonic</a></em> in your workflow, the following inputs are required:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<code>dds</code>, a <code>DESeqDataSet</code> containing the expression matrix;</li>
<li>
<code>res_de</code>, a <code>DESeqResults</code>, i.e. a <code>DataFrame</code> storing the results of the differentially expression analysis;</li>
<li>
<code>res_enrich</code>, a <code>data.frame</code> with the results of functional enrichment analysis;</li>
<li>
<code>annotation_obj</code>, a <code>data.frame</code> with the correspondence between identifiers for the features under inspection in the <code>dds</code> object.</li>
</ul>
<p>This workflow has mainly been tested with expression matrices with Ensembl identifiers, which are consistent and unambiguous across different releases, and results from functional enrichment analysis originating from ORA (OverRepresentation Analysis) methods, on the Gene Ontology signature database. It may need to be slightly adjusted to work with other formats and sources, but the core functionality will remain available.</p>
<p>In the remainder of this vignette, we will illustrate the main features of <em><a href="https://bioconductor.org/packages/3.11/GeneTonic">GeneTonic</a></em> on a publicly available dataset from Alasoo, et al. “Shared genetic effects on chromatin and gene expression indicate a role for enhancer priming in immune response”, published in Nature Genetics, January 2018 <span class="citation">(Alasoo et al. 2018)</span> <a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41588-018-0046-7">doi:10.1038/s41588-018-0046-7</a>.</p>
<p>The data is made available via the <em><a href="https://bioconductor.org/packages/3.11/macrophage">macrophage</a></em> Bioconductor package, which contains the files output from the Salmon quantification (version 0.12.0, with Gencode v29 reference), as well as the values summarized at the gene level, which we will use to exemplify.</p>
<p>In the <code>macrophage</code> experimental setting, the samples are available from 6 different donors, in 4 different conditions (naive, treated with Interferon gamma, with SL1344, or with a combination of Interferon gamma and SL1344). We will restrict our attention on the comparison between Interferon gamma treated samples vs naive samples.</p>

<a href="#gettingstarted" class="anchor"></a>Getting started</h1>
<p>To install this package, start R and enter:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb1"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb1-1" data-line-number="1"><span class="cf">if</span> (<span class="op">!</span><span class="kw"><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/base/ns-load.html">requireNamespace</a></span>(<span class="st">"BiocManager"</span>, <span class="dt">quietly =</span> <span class="ot">TRUE</span>))</a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb1-2" data-line-number="2">    <span class="kw"><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/utils/install.packages.html">install.packages</a></span>(<span class="st">"BiocManager"</span>)</a>

<p>Once installed, the package can be loaded and attached to your current workspace as follows:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb2"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb2-1" data-line-number="1"><span class="kw"><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/base/library.html">library</a></span>(<span class="st">"GeneTonic"</span>)</a></code></pre></div>
<p>If you have all four input elements ready, you can launch the <code><a href="../reference/GeneTonic.html">GeneTonic()</a></code> app by running:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb3"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb3-1" data-line-number="1"><span class="kw"><a href="../reference/GeneTonic.html">GeneTonic</a></span>(<span class="dt">dds =</span> dds_object,</a>

<a class="sourceLine" id="cb3-4" data-line-number="4">          <span class="dt">annotation_obj =</span> annotation_object,</a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb3-5" data-line-number="5">          <span class="dt">project_id =</span> <span class="st">"myFirstGeneTonic"</span>)</a></code></pre></div>
<p>In this vignette, we showcase the functionality of <em><a href="https://bioconductor.org/packages/3.11/GeneTonic">GeneTonic</a></em> using the gene-level summarized version of the <code>macrophage</code> dataset. If you want to dive in and start playing with the app immediately, you can simply run:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb4"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb4-1" data-line-number="1"><span class="kw"><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/utils/example.html">example</a></span>(<span class="st">"GeneTonic"</span>, <span class="dt">ask =</span> <span class="ot">FALSE</span>)</a></code></pre></div>
<p>Otherwise, you can follow the next chunks of code to generate the required input objects, step by step. In case some formatting requirements are expected, these will be specified in the text/comments, and they will be checked internally upon launching the <code>GeneTonic</code> app.</p>
<p>For running <code>GeneTonic</code>, you will need the four components mentioned above as parameters.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>
<code>dds</code>: First you will need a <code>DESeqDataSet</code>, which is the main component in the <code>DESeq2</code> framework and extends the widely adopted <code>SummarizedExperiment</code> class. This object will store the information related to the expression matrix.</li>
</ol>

<p><code>res_de</code>: Next you are going to need the results of Differential Expression analysis, computed on the <code>dds_macrophage</code> object you just obtained.</p>
<p>The expected format is a <code>DESeqResults</code> object. Here we are going to contrast two different conditions, <code>IFNg</code> and <code>naive</code>, while controlling for the cell line of origin (which has 6 levels, namely naive, IFNg, IFNg_SL1344, and SL1344).</p>
<p>We start by filtering lowly expressed features (at least 10 counts in at least 6 samples - 6 being the size of the smallest group). Then, we test against a null hypothesis of a log2FoldChange of 1 (instead of the default value of 0), in order to specify that we want to call DE genes with a consistent <em>and</em> robust expression change. Finally, we add the gene symbol to the output <code>DataFrame</code>.</p>

<p>The <code>GeneTonic</code> app is built with <em><a href="https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=shiny">shiny</a></em>, and its layout is built around the components of <em><a href="https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=bs4Dash">bs4Dash</a></em>, a modern looking dashboard based on Bootstrap 4.</p>
<div id="header-navbar" class="section level2">
<h2 class="hasAnchor">
<a href="#header-navbar" class="anchor"></a>Header (navbar)</h2>
<p>The dashboard navbar (as it is called in <code>bs4Dash</code>) contains two dropdown menus, which can be expanded by clicking on the respective icons (<i class="fa fa-question-circle"></i> and <i class="fa fa-info"></i>). These provide additional buttons to inspect… TODO</p>
<p>Additionally, one fundamental button is present in the navbar, and serves the purpose of bookmarking genes and gene sets of interest while exploring your data in an interactive session. This functionality will be exploited in the <i class="fa fa-bookmark"></i> section of the app, where a complete HTML report can be generated as a reproducible artifact.</p>
</div>
<div id="sidebar" class="section level2">
<h2 class="hasAnchor">
<a href="#sidebar" class="anchor"></a>Sidebar</h2>
<p>On the left side of the app, by clicking on the <i class="fa fa-bars"></i> icon (or if the app is viewed in full screen, by simply moving the mouse over to the left side), the sidebar menu is triggered. This constitutes the main way to access the different tabs of <code><a href="../reference/GeneTonic.html">GeneTonic()</a></code>, which will be explained in more detail in the next section (@ref(functionality)).</p>
</div>
<div id="controlbar" class="section level2">
<h2 class="hasAnchor">
<a href="#controlbar" class="anchor"></a>Controlbar</h2>
<p>The controlbar is triggered by clicking on the cogs <i class="fa fa-cogs"></i> icon on the upper right part of the navbar. There you can find widgets that control the appearance of output (plots, tables, graphs) in multiple tabs of the main application, such as for example the number of gene sets to focus your attention on.</p>
</div>
<div id="body" class="section level2">
<h2 class="hasAnchor">
<a href="#body" class="anchor"></a>Body</h2>
<p>The main body of the <code>GeneTonic</code> application is structured in tabs that are activated by clicking on the respective icons or text in the sidebar.</p>
<p>While the Welcome tab might be self-explanatory, the functionality of each tab can go in depth, and new users can benefit of the &lt;button id=“tour_” type=“button” class=“btn btn-default action-button” style=color: #0092AC; background-color: #FFFFFF; border-color: #FFFFFF&gt; <i class="fa fa-question-circle"></i>  button to trigger an interactive tour of <code>GeneTonic</code>, which allows users to learn the basic usage mechanisms by doing. During a tour, the highlighted elements respond to the user’s actions, while the rest of the UI is kept shaded. Tours can be interrupted anytime by clicking outside of the focused window, and arrows (left, right) can be used as well to navigate between steps. The tour functionality is provided by the beautiful <em><a href="https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=rintrojs">rintrojs</a></em> package.</p>

<a href="#faqs" class="anchor"></a>FAQs</h1>
<p><strong>Q: Why is this package called <code>GeneTonic</code>?</strong></p>
<p>A: For obvious reasons :) Like a cocktail, ingredients (expression matrix, results from DE, and results from functional enrichment analysis) do taste better together. Plus, I like puns with words. And cocktails. Sometimes simultaneously.</p>
<p><strong>Q: My configuration on two machines is somewhat different, so I am having difficulty in finding out what packages are different. Is there something tio help on this?</strong></p>
<p>A: Yes, you can check out <em><a href="https://github.com/federicomarini/sessionDiffo">sessionDiffo</a></em>, a small utility to compare the outputs of two different <code>sessionInfo</code> outputs. This can help you pinpoint what packages might be causing the issue.</p>
<p><strong>Q: I am using a different service/software for generating the results of functional enrichment analysis. How do I plug this into <code>GeneTonic</code>?</strong></p>
<p>A: You can set up a small conversion function, on the line of <code>shake_topGOtableResult</code> and <code>shake_enrichResult</code> (<em>use the source, Luke</em> to see how you can build your own), or request such a function - make sure to specify the formatting specifications of your tool of choice (e.g. David, g:Profiler, or commercial solutions such as Ingenuity Pathway Analysis).</p>
<p><strong>Q: I’d like to try <code>GeneTonic</code> but I could not install it/I just want a quick peek into it. What can I do for this?</strong></p>
<p>A: We set up an instance of <code>GeneTonic</code> running on the <code>macrophage</code> dataset at this address: <a href="http://shiny.imbei.uni-mainz.de:3838/GeneTonic" class="uri">http://shiny.imbei.uni-mainz.de:3838/GeneTonic</a>. TODOTODO</p>
